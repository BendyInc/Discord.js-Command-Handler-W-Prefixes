# Discord.js-Command-Handler-W-Prefixes

This is a starter kit for organized discord bots! To add a command, simply create a file. Name it something like 'ping.js'. Now, anytime you say '{preixinconfigjson}ping', the bot responds with pong! Take a look at the example command in the folder named 'examples'. I recommend duplciating it and putting the duplicate in the commands folder, then modifying it from there.

That's all there is to it!

Note: If you wish to use slash commands (interactions) instead of preifx commands, take a look at my other GitHub project:

As I said, this project is bugged and I'm pretty sure Glitch blocked discord.js.

If it isn't working for you, please contact me at Vaneer#3371 and I'd be happy to help you out! If I decline your friend request, send it again. It's just me being super-stitious about advertising bots.
